# Repository for Solutions and Models from "Model Building in Mathematical Programming, Fifth Edition" by H. Paul Williams

This repository contains solutions and model implementations for the exercises and examples presented in *Model Building in Mathematical Programming, Fifth Edition* by H. Paul Williams. It is designed as a comprehensive resource for understanding the mathematical programming concepts discussed in the book.


## Contents:
- **Mathematical Model Making**: Mathematical formulations of the problems and examples in the book.
  
- **Model Implementation in Gurobi**: Python code implementing the models using the Gurobi optimizer for solving optimization problems.
  
- **Application Using Streamlit**: Interactive web applications built with Streamlit to visualize and interact with the mathematical models and solutions.
  

## Streamlit Dashboards:
Below are the links to the interactive Streamlit dashboards, where you can visualize and interact with the optimization models and solutions:
